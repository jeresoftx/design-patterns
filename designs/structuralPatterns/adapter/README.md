# Dessing Pattern Adapter

[Incio](../../../README-es.md)

The Adapter Pattern is used to allow two incompatible interfaces to work together. An adapter acts as an intermediary between two objects that cannot communicate directly.

## Examples

1. [Typescript](./adapter.ts)
1. [Python](./adapter.py)
1. [Kotlin](./adapter.kt)
